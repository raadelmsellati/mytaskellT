# MyTASKELL

MyTaskell, is a command-line tool works as a task manager enables users to manage their 
to-do lists and tasks. Users can see their tasks by several criteria, such as due date or priority, and 
add, change, and delete tasks as needed. A straightforward file-based database will be used by the 
task manager to store task data, and it will be written in Haskell.
