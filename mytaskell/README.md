# MyTASKELL

MyTaskell, is a command-line tool works as a task manager enables users to manage their 
to-do lists and tasks. Users can see their tasks by several criteria, such as due date or priority, and 
add, change, and delete tasks as needed. A straightforward file-based database will be used by the 
task manager to store task data, and it will be written in Haskell.

# Features:
    * A command-line interface will be used by MyTaskell's user interface, which will consist of a number of menus and prompts.
    * Task creation: Users can add tasks to their task list by giving it a Name, description, DueDate, priority.
    * Users have the ability to modify current tasks by modifying its Name, description, dueDate, and priority.
    * Users have the option of deleting tasks from their task list by name.
    * Users can sort the tasks in their list by priority, Low TO High.
    * Users are able to filter their list of tasks by a specific prioirty. If prio = 8, then view only all the tasks with 8 prio.
    * Users can label their task as finished after it is done.
